* #117 TypeScript conversion. Type definitions should now match behavior exactly. By @NaridaL
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `@serializeAll("*": ModelSchema)` is no longer valid. Instead you should pass
  `@serializeAll("*": object(ModelSchema))`.
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: `{"*": object(...)}` and `{"x": object(...)}` now behave the same when
  deserializing `{"x": "str_not_object"}` (result: `{x: null}`). Previously the `"*"` schema would
  have returned `{}`.
* **BREAKING CHANGE**: Removed deprecated `ref` and `child` functions. Use `reference` and `object`
  instead.
* You can pass a `pattern` argument as `AdditionalPropArgs` instead of having to manually assign it
  to a PropSchema: `@serializeAll("*": list(primitive(), { pattern: /^_.*/ }))`. Note this only make
  sense together with the `"*"` property.

* Improved documentation examples, see #43 by @brikou
* Fixed `class constructor cannot be invoked without 'new'` error, see #42 by @pinksquidhat
* Introduced `mapAsArray`, to support maps that serialize to arrays with objects with identifiers. And vice versa. By @vonovak. See #22

# 1.1.11

* Fixed #27: Skip non primitive primitive properties instead of throwing for `*` decorator

# 1.1.10

# 1.1.8

* Fixed #21 wrong export of `setDefaultModelSchema` export, by @vonovak

# 1.1.7

# 1.1.6

# 1.1.2 / 1.1.3

* Fixed UMD build issues

# 1.1.1

* Fixed package.json: d.ts files are now exported as well (#7)

# 1.1

_Which should have been called 1.0...:-)_

* the `lookupFunction` of `ref` is now optional, if it is not provided, serializr will try to resolve the reference within the current document. Types are respected while resolving
* `ref` has been renamed to `reference`
* `child` has been renamed to `object`
* `false` is now also an acceptable value for propSchema's
* the prop schema `"*": true` now has the special meaning that all enumerable, primitive fields will be serialized. Will throw on non-primitive fields
* introduced `custom(serializer, deserializer)`
* `identifier` now supports an optional callback that can be used to register new instances in some store
* circular dependency on default schema's for classes are now a bit better handled (but remain a fundamental JS problem, especially for classes)

# 1.0
